              content: "Alright, scientist — you now know what an Arduino is.\nBut guess what? There’s not just one Arduino… there’s a whole family of them!\n\nJust like how in your house you have big people, tiny people, and maybe even a noisy pet — Arduino has its own gang of boards.\nEach one has its own size, power, and special skills.\n\nLet’s meet some of them!\n\n1️⃣ Arduino Uno\nThis is the most famous one. It’s like the big brother of the family.\nPerfect for beginners, projects, and learning how to blink those first LEDs.\n\n2️⃣ Arduino Nano\nThis one’s the tiny ninja. Super small, but still powerful.\nGreat when you don’t have much space.\n\n3️⃣ Arduino Mega\nWhoa — this one’s huge!\nIt has lots more pins and memory.\nPerfect for when you want to connect loads of sensors and make something epic.\n\n4️⃣ Arduino Leonardo\nThis cool dude can pretend to be a computer keyboard or mouse.\nYup — it can type stuff for you or move your mouse cursor!\n\nAnd there are many more — but these are the ones you’ll hear about a lot.\n\nSo, next time you see a tiny green board with black chips on it — you can proudly say,\n“Hey! That’s an Arduino Uno!” or “Look! It’s a Nano!”\n\nPretty cool, huh?\nAlright — let’s move on and see how to set up your very own Arduino next!",
