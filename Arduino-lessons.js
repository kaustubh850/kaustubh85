              content: "Welcome to Module 1 of our awesome Arduino adventure!\nYou made it here — and you’re about to discover something super cool.\n\nSo… what’s this weird name… Arduino?\nIs it a superhero?\nA robot?\nA pizza topping?\nNope — it’s even cooler than that.\n\nArduino is a tiny little computer that can fit in your hand.\nIt’s like a brain for your robots, gadgets, and cool inventions!\n\nImagine you want to make a robot car, or a light that switches on when you clap, or a plant pot that tells you when it’s thirsty — Arduino makes all of that happen.\n\nAnd the best part?\nYou don’t need to be a boring scientist in a white coat.\nEven you, sitting right there in your room, can start making stuff move, blink, beep and dance!\n\nBut wait… how does it work?\nWell — Arduino talks to the real world using sensors (like eyes and ears for your robot), and it controls things like LEDs, motors and screens.\nYou tell it what to do using simple code — and magic happens.\n\nOver the next few modules, we’re gonna build, code, and have so much fun that you won’t even realize you’re learning real electronics and coding stuff.\n\nSo buckle up, scientist… your journey into the world of Arduino starts now!",

              content: "Alright, scientist — you now know what an Arduino is.\nBut guess what? There’s not just one Arduino… there’s a whole family of them!\n\nJust like how in your house you have big people, tiny people, and maybe even a noisy pet — Arduino has its own gang of boards.\nEach one has its own size, power, and special skills.\n\nLet’s meet some of them!\n\n1️⃣ Arduino Uno\nThis is the most famous one. It’s like the big brother of the family.\nPerfect for beginners, projects, and learning how to blink those first LEDs.\n\n2️⃣ Arduino Nano\nThis one’s the tiny ninja. Super small, but still powerful.\nGreat when you don’t have much space.\n\n3️⃣ Arduino Mega\nWhoa — this one’s huge!\nIt has lots more pins and memory.\nPerfect for when you want to connect loads of sensors and make something epic.\n\n4️⃣ Arduino Leonardo\nThis cool dude can pretend to be a computer keyboard or mouse.\nYup — it can type stuff for you or move your mouse cursor!\n\nAnd there are many more — but these are the ones you’ll hear about a lot.\n\nSo, next time you see a tiny green board with black chips on it — you can proudly say,\n“Hey! That’s an Arduino Uno!” or “Look! It’s a Nano!”\n\nPretty cool, huh?\nAlright — let’s move on and see how to set up your very own Arduino next!",
