              content: "Alright, scientist — you now know what an Arduino is.\nBut guess what? There’s not just one Arduino… there’s a whole family of them!\n\nJust like how in your house you have big people, tiny people, and maybe even a noisy pet — Arduino has its own gang of boards.\nEach one has its own size, power, and special skills.\n\nLet’s meet some of them!\n\n1️⃣ Arduino Uno\nThis is the most famous one. It’s like the big brother of the family.\nPerfect for beginners, projects, and learning how to blink those first LEDs.\n\n2️⃣ Arduino Nano\nThis one’s the tiny ninja. Super small, but still powerful.\nGreat when you don’t have much space.\n\n3️⃣ Arduino Mega\nWhoa — this one’s huge!\nIt has lots more pins and memory.\nPerfect for when you want to connect loads of sensors and make something epic.\n\n4️⃣ Arduino Leonardo\nThis cool dude can pretend to be a computer keyboard or mouse.\nYup — it can type stuff for you or move your mouse cursor!\n\nAnd there are many more — but these are the ones you’ll hear about a lot.\n\nSo, next time you see a tiny green board with black chips on it — you can proudly say,\n“Hey! That’s an Arduino Uno!” or “Look! It’s a Nano!”\n\nPretty cool, huh?\nAlright — let’s move on and see how to set up your very own Arduino next!",

                title:"Types of Arduinos — Which Tribe Does Your Board Belong To?",
                content:"Alright scientist — now that you’ve met a few popular Arduino boards, it’s time to learn about the different categories they belong to.

                Yep — not all Arduinos are made for the same job.
                Some are for learning, some for factories, some for tiny gadgets you can wear, and some for controlling entire homes!
                
                Let’s check out the types:
                
                📌 1️⃣ Classic Arduino Boards
                These are the most famous and beginner-friendly boards.
                Perfect for learning electronics, making robots, and building fun DIY projects.
                Examples: Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega, Leonardo.
                
                📌 2️⃣ Enhanced & Powerful Boards
                These are advanced boards with faster processors and extra memory.
                They’re great when your project needs more speed or handles lots of data.
                Examples: Arduino Due, Portenta H7.
                
                📌 3️⃣ IoT (Internet of Things) Boards
                These boards can connect to WiFi or Bluetooth.
                They’re perfect for projects like smart lights, remote robot control, or plant watering systems you control from your phone.
                Examples: Arduino MKR1000, MKR WiFi 1010, Nano 33 IoT.
                
                📌 4️⃣ Wearable Boards
                Tiny boards you can attach to clothes or toys.
                Great for making smart jackets, glowing caps, or motion-sensing bracelets.
                Example: Arduino Gemma, LilyPad.
                
                📌 5️⃣ Industrial Boards
                Tough boards made for factories and big machines.
                They can work in hot, dusty places without getting tired.
                Examples: Arduino Nicla Vision, Arduino Edge Control.
                
                📌 6️⃣ Special-Purpose Boards
                Boards designed for special tricks like voice control, AI, or computer vision.
                Examples: Arduino Nicla Voice, Arduino Nicla Sense ME.
                
                📝 Final Thought
                Now you know — every Arduino board belongs to a type.
                Some are for learning, some for smart homes, and some for robot factories!
                When you pick a board, check which type it belongs to — and you’ll know if it’s perfect for your job!
