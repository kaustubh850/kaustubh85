  content: "Welcome to Module 1 of our awesome Arduino adventure!
You made it here — and you’re about to discover something super cool.

So… what’s this weird name… Arduino?
Is it a superhero?
A robot?
A pizza topping?
Nope — it’s even cooler than that.

Arduino is a tiny little computer that can fit in your hand.
It’s like a brain for your robots, gadgets, and cool inventions!

Imagine you want to make a robot car, or a light that switches on when you clap, or a plant pot that tells you when it’s thirsty — Arduino makes all of that happen.

And the best part?
You don’t need to be a boring scientist in a white coat.
Even you, sitting right there in your room, can start making stuff move, blink, beep and dance!

But wait… how does it work?
Well — Arduino talks to the real world using sensors (like eyes and ears for your robot), and it controls things like LEDs, motors and screens.
You tell it what to do using simple code — and magic happens.

Over the next few modules, we’re gonna build, code, and have so much fun that you won’t even realize you’re learning real electronics and coding stuff.

So buckle up, scientist… your journey into the world of Arduino starts now!

      content:"Alright, scientist — you now know what an Arduino is.
But guess what? There’s not just one Arduino… there’s a whole family of them!

Just like how in your house you have big people, tiny people, and maybe even a noisy pet — Arduino has its own gang of boards.
Each one has its own size, power, and special skills.

Let’s meet some of them!

1️⃣ Arduino Uno
This is the most famous one. It’s like the big brother of the family.
Perfect for beginners, projects, and learning how to blink those first LEDs.

2️⃣ Arduino Nano
This one’s the tiny ninja. Super small, but still powerful.
Great when you don’t have much space.

3️⃣ Arduino Mega
Whoa — this one’s huge!
It has lots more pins and memory.
Perfect for when you want to connect loads of sensors and make something epic.

4️⃣ Arduino Leonardo
This cool dude can pretend to be a computer keyboard or mouse.
Yup — it can type stuff for you or move your mouse cursor!

And there are many more — but these are the ones you’ll hear about a lot.

So, next time you see a tiny green board with black chips on it — you can proudly say,
“Hey! That’s an Arduino Uno!” or “Look! It’s a Nano!”

Pretty cool, huh?
Alright — let’s move on and see how to set up your very own Arduino next!
