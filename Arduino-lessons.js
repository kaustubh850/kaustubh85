We're about to breathe life into your Arduino, one blink at a time.\n\n🧠 <b>What's Happening?</b>\nWe'll write a program (called a sketch) that tells your Arduino to blink its onboard LED. It's on pin 13 by default.\n\n👨‍💻 <b>The Code:</b>\n<code>void setup() {\n  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);\n  delay(1000);\n  digitalWrite(13, LOW);\n  delay(1000);\n}</code>\n\n💡 <b>Explanation:</b>\n- <code>setup()</code>: Runs once. Sets pin 13 as an output pin.\n- <code>loop()</code>: Runs again and again. Turns the LED on, waits a second, turns it off, waits again. Rinse and repeat.\n\n🎯 <b>Mission:</b>\n- Copy the code into your Arduino IDE.\n- Click ✅ Verify to check for errors.\n- Hit 🔼 Upload to send it to your Arduino.\n- Watch that LED blink like it's saying “Hello World!” in Morse code.\n\n🥳 <b>You've just completed your first Arduino ritual.

<h3>What are Digital Pins?</h3>
Digital pins on your Arduino are your board’s way of interacting with the physical world — like sending a signal to an LED or listening for a button press.
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Output Mode (pinMode: OUTPUT)</h3>
When you set a pin as OUTPUT, your Arduino can send either HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V) from that pin. Use this to control LEDs, buzzers, and more.
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Input Mode (pinMode: INPUT)</h3>
Set a pin to INPUT mode when you want your Arduino to "listen" to sensors, buttons, or switches. It reads either HIGH or LOW based on voltage.
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Input Pullup (pinMode: INPUT_PULLUP)</h3>
Sometimes a pin floats unpredictably when no voltage is connected. INPUT_PULLUP connects an internal resistor to keep it stable at HIGH until grounded.
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Common Mistake to Avoid</h3>
Don’t drive heavy components like motors directly from pins! Use a transistor or driver circuit. The digital pin outputs small current — not enough for power-hungry parts.
