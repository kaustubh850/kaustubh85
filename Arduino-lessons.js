There‚Äôs not just one Arduino‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a whole family of them!\n\nJust like how in your house you have big people, tiny people, and maybe even a noisy pet ‚Äî Arduino has its own gang of boards.\nEach one has its own size, power, and special skills.\n\nLet‚Äôs meet some of them!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino Uno\nThis is the most famous one. It‚Äôs like the big brother of the family.\nPerfect for beginners, projects, and learning how to blink those first LEDs.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino Nano\nThis one‚Äôs the tiny ninja. Super small, but still powerful.\nGreat when you don‚Äôt have much space.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino Mega\nWhoa ‚Äî this one‚Äôs huge!\nIt has lots more pins and memory.\nPerfect for when you want to connect loads of sensors and make something epic.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino Leonardo\nThis cool dude can pretend to be a computer keyboard or mouse.\nYup ‚Äî it can type stuff for you or move your mouse cursor!\n\nAnd there are many more ‚Äî but these are the ones you‚Äôll hear about a lot.\n\nSo, next time you see a tiny green board with black chips on it ‚Äî you can proudly say,\n‚ÄúHey! That‚Äôs an Arduino Uno!‚Äù or ‚ÄúLook! It‚Äôs a Nano!‚Äù\n\nPretty cool, huh?\nAlright ‚Äî let‚Äôs move on and see how to set up your very own Arduino next!",

content:"Okay scientist ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to take a super close look at your robot's brain: the **Arduino Uno** board!\nIt‚Äôs filled with tiny parts, each one with its own special job.\nLet‚Äôs meet them all!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **USB Port**\nThis is where you plug in the USB cable to connect your Arduino to your computer.\nIt sends your code to the board and powers it up.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **Power Jack**\nThis is where you can connect a battery or power adapter when your Arduino isn‚Äôt connected to your computer.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ **Digital Pins (0 to 13)**\nLittle holes you connect wires to.\nThey can turn LEDs on and off, read buttons, and send signals.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ **Analog Pins (A0 to A5)**\nThese read values from sensors like temperature, light, or sound.\nThey understand signals between 0 to 5 volts.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ **GND (Ground Pins)**\nThese are the black pins used to complete your circuits.\nWithout them, nothing will work!\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ **5V and 3.3V Pins**\nThey give power to your sensors and LEDs.\n5V is for most things, 3.3V is for special modules.\n\n7Ô∏è‚É£ **Reset Button**\nIf your board freezes, press this to restart it.\nLike a tiny refresh button.\n\n8Ô∏è‚É£ **ATmega328P Microcontroller Chip**\nThe black rectangular chip in the middle.\nIt‚Äôs the brain of your Arduino that runs your code.\n\n9Ô∏è‚É£ **TX and RX LEDs**\nTiny lights that blink when your board is sending or receiving data.\nThey show your Arduino is talking to your computer.\n\nüîü **Crystal Oscillator**\nA tiny silver part next to the chip.\nIt keeps time for your Arduino, helping it count seconds and control timing in your code.\nIt runs at 16 MHz ‚Äî super fast!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **Voltage Regulator**\nA tiny black part near the power jack.\nIt controls how much voltage your board gets, keeping it safe from too much power.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **Power LED (ON LED)**\nA tiny light that stays on when your Arduino has power.\nIf this is off, something‚Äôs wrong!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) Header Pins**\nA group of six pins next to the chip.\nThey‚Äôre used to program the Arduino chip directly if it stops working.\nThink of it like a secret backdoor.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **Resettable Polyfuse**\nA tiny yellow part near the USB port.\nIt protects your Arduino from too much current.\nIf you draw too much power, it‚Äôll disconnect and reconnect when things are safe again.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **AREF (Analog Reference) Pin**\nIt‚Äôs used to set a custom voltage limit for analog readings.\nYou‚Äôll use this in some advanced projects.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ **Serial Header Pins**\nThese extra pins connect to the USB chip on your board.\nThey help with serial communication.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ **Barrel Jack Protection Diode**\nA tiny black part next to the power jack.\nIt stops power from going the wrong way and damaging your board.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs it!\nNow you know every tiny part of your Arduino Uno.\nYou‚Äôre not just a scientist ‚Äî you‚Äôre officially a robot brain master now!\nLet‚Äôs get it blinking!",
